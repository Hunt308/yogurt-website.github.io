# yogurt-website.github.io

My previous two websites were very advance CSS and serious topics. I decided to mix it up and make a yogurt website. 
One of the things I struggled with in css is reponsive design. This website is the first time it is completely responsive with a toggle button. 
This was largely thanks to flex-basis and giving them sizes that is very responsive and using a row that align items differently depending on their sides
This was also nice to use icons that clickableAlso able to use google maps in makes these websites even more useful. 
The toggle button was hard but it ended up working well in the end and happy with it. 
This was mainly fun practice to see how responsiveness can work with flexbox and an easier fun break from the harder projects. 
Only took about 2 days to make compared to previous that took a week or more. 
This was the first time I made a simple website since Harry Potter website in January, but unlike the Harry Potter website where it was floats, this used Flexbox more better. 

-First time using google maps in website and embed them
-First time using flex basis and mesuring 
-First time using sidebars 
-First time using lines made from classes
-First time making a fully responsive clean looking website 
-First time making a contact form with required 
-First time making icons clickable 
-First time making a toggle button used the right way.
